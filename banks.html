            <h3 class="post-headers">Banks teaches you to prioritise what is important.</h3>
            <p class="post">Banks usually operate from 10 AM to 3 PM during weekdays. This aligns with their work hours for most people. More often than not you are forced to find time between your busy schedule to deal with your bank related issues. They teach you that is important to find time to deal with matters of concern. And most importantly they teach you that if you prioritise something, you often end up finding time for it.</p>
            <h3 class="post-headers">Banks teaches you to take responsibility</h3>
            <p class="post">Banks provide one of the vaguest forms of customer service, followed just by your telecom provider. But that is a post for another day. Banks often expect you to diagnose the issue you are facing. They often have the attitude "Your money, Your responsibility".  Banks push you to be responsible and do self-research on issues you might be facing. </p>
            <h3 class="post-headers">Bank teaches you to hang in there.</h3>
            <p class ="post"> How often do you complain about the poor service your bank provides? How often have you switched banks? Banks teaches you that despite the terrible service or the average service they provide, it is better to just hang in there. Bank teaches us that sometimes it is better to leave things as it is and adjust to the situations and conflicts that arise.</p>
            <h3 class="post-headers">Lastly, Banks teaches you that you'll face problems wherever you are.</h3>
            <p class="post">One of the most important life lessons, a bank can teach you is that irrespective of your banking provider, you are going to face a lot of issues. This teaches us the universal truth that no matter where you are, and who you are you'll face problems. Every place and person has its flaws. We just need to hang in there.</p>
